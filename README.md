HelixForge is the working title for the new builder for Sitecore Helix Solutions.

It's modular and does not only work with Helix solutions, or even sitecore - so you can use it for all your building purposes.

## The plan

1. Build everything in one repro as a PoC, but in a modular way.
2. Split it into meaningful npm packages, for example the configuration reader could be it's own.
3. Create a yeoman generator to scaffold to your project needs.
